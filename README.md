# Note Taker

## Description
A website to store user notes.

## Usage
The main function of this website is to take user input in the form of notes and store it in a database so that the user may continue to access their notes. Notes are created when the user inputs a title and body, and then hits the save button - this should make the note appear in the saved notes on the left-hand side. When the user clicks a saved note, it will appear in full on the right-hand side so that the user may see the body of the note. The user can also delete a saved note by clicking the trash icon next to the note title.
